we've packaged the code. to make changes, in case anything is wrong with 
the packaged code (our custom library including the environments), you 
need to make changes, commit them, push them, and then, with the virtual 
environment active, from the project home directory's parent directory, 
run the command 'pip install -e gym-examples'. this will reinstall the 
package from the corresponding github repo.

then, to import the stuff, you do the usual (although the typical usage 
isn't quite as shown below):
'from gym_examples.envs import GridWorldEnv'
